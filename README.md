Dive into the structure of security teams, learn how to advance in your SOC career, and understand the vital role SOC professionals play in defending against cyber threats.

## Key Learning Objectives:
1. Understand the concept and purpose of the **Blue Team**.
2. Explore the place of the **SOC** within the company structure.
3. Learn about the career path of a **SOC L1 Analyst**.

## Prerequisites:
- Complete the **Junior Security Analyst Intro** room [here](https://tryhackme.com/room/jrsecanalystintrouxo).

## Task 1: Introduction

In this task, we explore the essential questions regarding the **SOC L1 Analyst** role and its placement in the security hierarchy. You will also learn about the path to advancing through your SOC career and how to become a key member of a security team.

## Task 2: Security Hierarchy

Security priorities vary for different industries. For example, a law firm prioritizes document privacy, while a hospital focuses on patient safety. The **Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)** typically oversees cybersecurity decisions in large organizations, which are often split into specialized teams, such as:

- **Red Team:** Offensive security experts (ethical hackers and pentesters).
- **GRC Team:** Governance, Risk, and Compliance professionals.
- **Blue Team:** Defensive security experts, including **SOC analysts**.

## Task 3: Meet the Blue Team

The **Blue Team** focuses on **defensive security**. These professionals monitor for attacks, respond to threats, and implement defense strategies. SOC is at the heart of any Blue Team and is typically where you will start your cybersecurity career.

### SOC Team Structure:
- **L1 Analysts:** Handle alerts and escalate complex cases.
- **L2 Analysts:** Investigate advanced attacks.
- **Engineers:** Configure security tools like **EDR** and **SIEM**.
- **Manager:** Oversees the entire SOC team.

If SOC expertise isn't enough, the **Cyber Incident Response Team (CIRT)** steps in to handle larger, more complex incidents.

## Task 4: Advancing SOC Career

Starting as a **SOC L1 Analyst** provides an excellent foundation for expanding your knowledge and skills. After gaining experience, you can advance to roles such as **SOC L2 Analyst**, or explore other career paths like **Incident Response**, **Digital Forensics**, or even managerial roles.

### Career Tips:
- Practice core SOC skills.
- Participate in **CTFs** and stay updated on **cybersecurity news**.
- Consider earning certifications like **SAL1**.
- Prepare for interviews and understand the difference between an **Internal SOC** and a **Managed Security Services Provider (MSSP)**.

## Task 5: Final Challenge
